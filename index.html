                <h1 class="text-color text-center px-1">About</h1>
                <p class="px-1 justify-center">Harry Potter, fictional character, a boy wizard created by British author J.K. Rowling. His coming-of-age exploits were the subject of seven enormously popular novels (1997–2007), which were adapted into eight films (2001–11); a play and a book of its script appeared in 2016.</p>
                <h2 class="text-center text-color px-1">Series summary</h2>
                <p class="px-1 justify-center">Harry Potter was first introduced in the novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (1997; also published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone), as an orphan who is mistreated by his guardian aunt and uncle and their son. On his 11th birthday Harry discovers that his parents were a witch and a wizard and that he, a wizard himself, has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also learns that his parents had not perished in a car accident, as his aunt and uncle had told him, but that they instead had been murdered by an evil wizard named Voldemort. Harry was the only person to have ever survived an attack by Voldemort—by somehow rebounding the latter’s “killing curse”—which left him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Indeed, Harry’s mysterious survival had all but killed Voldemort, who was left disembodied, and the young boy was thus already a celebrated figure in the “wizarding” community. At Hogwarts Harry becomes fast friends with classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and finds a rival in Draco Malfoy. He is taken under the wing of the school’s headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. These relationships persist throughout the series, especially as the young wizards and witches grow older and are called upon to take sides in a growing wizard war.

                Unbeknownst to Harry, and to much of the wizarding world in general, Voldemort is planning a return to power. Although at firstfeeble and living as a parasite in a follower’s body, Voldemort makes attempts on Harry’s life beginning in the first book andcontinuing throughout the series. In the fourth volume, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Voldemort regains his bodyand former strength through a magic ritual, and thereafter his army greatly increases in number. Harry and those who side withhim—including some of his teachers, several classmates, and other members of the wizarding community—are forced on multipleoccasions to battle Voldemort and his disciples, including the Malfoy family. The epic saga culminates with Harry accepting hisrole as the iconic “boy who lived” and facing almost certain death in the struggle against the evil wizard. With help from thosewho love him and believe in him, he is able to emerge victorious.

                Harry’s story continued in the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which premiered in 2016. In the production, which was based on a story cowritten by Rowling, Harry is married to Ginny Weasley, and they are the parents of James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Although working for the Ministry of Magic, Harry continues to struggle with his past, while Albus must contend with his father’s legacy.
